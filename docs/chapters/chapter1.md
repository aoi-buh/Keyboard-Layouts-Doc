# Chapter 1: Typing basics (7 min)
This chapter goes over some typing basics and also looks at angle mod in detail. If you are already familiar with those concepts you can probably skip, or quickly scroll by, this part.

## Touch typing
 
Touch typing refers to developing the necessary muscle memory to be able to type without looking at the keyboard and without consciously thinking about it.

Proper touch typing technique involves using eight fingers (pinky, ring, middle and index of each hand). In the following image, each color highlights the keys assigned to that finger. The color code is as follows: green for pinky, light blue for ring, pink for middle, orange for left index, and yellow for right index. The space bar would be pressed by either thumb.

![*Standard Fingering*](assets/standard fingering.png)

**We will refer to the model above as standard fingering.** There are many people who do not follow this model, as they learned to type on their own without the use of a typing tutor. However, **if we want to learn an alternative keyboard layout, we will also have to learn the correct typing technique, as layouts are designed with it in mind.** Otherwise, we won’t get the benefit of the layout.

If you currently do not use all your fingers when typing, arguably the best reason for learning a new layout is to take it as an opportunity to learn proper touch typing.

## The home row

The usual approach for learning touch typing is to break it in steps. The first step consists of getting used to typing the letters on the home row without looking at the keyboard. **The home row refers to the eight keys that act as the resting position for your fingers:**

![*Homerow Method*](assets/homerow method.png)

The image above shows the home row on a standard [Qwerty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY) keyboard. We should be able to place our hands in this position without looking at the keyboard, by feeling with our index fingers the two small bumps in the F and J keys.

**Learning the home row before anything else will be very helpful, as we can then develop the muscle memory for the rest of the keyboard in relation to the home row.**

Note that, when we say that our fingers will be resting over ASDF JKL; , we are simply describing the physical location on the keyboard. The intention is to learn a keyboard layout other than Qwerty. Any modern layout will replace ASDF JKL; with more common letters.

## The top and bottom row

After learning the home row, the next step would be practicing the muscle memory for the row of keys that is directly above it, known as the top row. Lastly, we would do the same with the row of keys directly below the home row, which is referred to as the bottom row.

## How to learn a new layout

A useful tool for this is a word filter. The [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com/) website already has a word filter built in. To use it, near the top right corner, **click on custom → change → Words filter.**

By default, MonkeyType only uses the 200 most common English words to generate its tests. Before anything, we should click on **language** and select an expanded word set. English 1k includes the 1000 most common words in English, 5k includes the top 5000, etc...

In the word filter menu, we will see the following two boxes:
![*MT Word Filter*](assets/mt word filter.png)
By adding a set of letters (separated by space) in include, and putting all the remaining letters in exclude, we can generate a typing test that uses only the letters we want. This in turn can be used to learn a layout in steps. For example, take the MTGAP layout:
[Mtgap](https://mathematicalmulticore.wordpress.com/the-keyboard-layout-project/)
```
y p o u j  k d l c w
i n e a ,  m h t s r
q z ' . :  b f g v x
```

Let’s say we wanted to practice the home row. Firstly, we select a word set like English 1k. Secondly, we add all of MTGAP’s home row letters to the include box, and put all the remaining letters in exclude. Finally, we click **set**, resulting in the following word list:

![*Mtgap Wordlist*](assets/mtgap word list.png)

All there is left to do is click on **random** (to randomize the order in which the above words will appear in the typing test) and select a duration for the test (either a number of words or of second). We can now practice MTGAP’s home row while typing actual words.

Once we are comfortable with the home row, we go back to the word filter screen and progressively move more letters from **exclude** to **include**, until we have learned all of them. How many steps this process should take is entirely up to you.

## Word tests

If we have already learned all the letters in our layout, then we do not need the word filter anymore. Now we can start using either the **time** or **words** settings on [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com/).

We can select how long the test will last (either a time in seconds, or how many words it will contain). The default is 50 seconds or 60 words. Regardless, we can change it.

Remember to practice on a bigger word set than the default English option, as that one only includes the 200 most common English words, and should only be used for speed typing.

## Punctuation and shift

By clicking on the **punctuation**** option, we add basic punctuation to the test: comma `,`, period `.`, apostrophe `‘`, colon `:`, semicolon `;`, hyphen `-`, slash `/`, question mark `?`, exclamation point `!`, quotation marks `“”` and parentheses `()`.

Enabling punctuation also forces us to practice using Shift (the key with an arrow pointing upwards) in order to capitalize letters. **The correct technique is to use the Shift key of the hand opposite to the letter we want to capitalize.** In other words, if we want to capitalize a letter on the left hand, we should use the right Shift key (and vice versa).

The issue with using Shift on the same side as the letter we want to capitalize is that our fingers will be pulled apart (e.g. try holding the right Shift plus the letter Y on Qwerty). Although learning to use Shift correctly is tricky, it will be worth it in the long run.

## Quotes

Once we are comfortable with punctuation and Shift we can start using the **quote** setting to practice full sentences, rather than individual words as we had been doing until now.

We can select how long we want the quotes to be. There is even an option to search through all the quotes on MonkeyType to choose specific ones. If we want to practice texts of our own choice, we can click on **custom → change**, and paste our desired text.

## Swapping Caps lock and Backspace (on Windows)

Despite the Backspace key being a commonly used key, it is very far from the right pinky’s resting position, forcing us to make quite a jump to reach it. A fix some people do is moving Backspace to where Caps lock used to be, making Backspace more comfortable to press:

![*Backspace*](assets/backspace.png)

If you want to try the fix above, download and unzip the following [file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YJ18K7IExs46LcBsPWIDf6ejOMOpozrl/view?usp=sharing). Afterward, you can run the .reg file of your choice, and reboot your computer for it to take effect:

- Caps2BS.reg - Rebind Caps to Backspace
- SwapCapsBS.reg - Swap Caps and Backspace
- Caps2Ctrl.reg - Rebind Caps to Control
- SwapCapsCtrl.reg - Swap Caps and Control
- Unbind.reg - Undo All Rebinds

The first .reg file simply makes the Caps lock key act as a second Backspace. In other words, the old Backspace would still work, and we would not have a Caps lock key anymore.

With the second .reg file, Caps lock and Backspace are swapped. So, this option retains a Caps lock key, plus it forces us to get used to utilizing the new Backspace location.

Anyway, Credit goes to Ze_or for making the above file.

# Angle mod (10 min)
## Improved typing technique

On standard keyboards, each row is shifted a bit to the side in relation to one another. This is known as the row stagger. **When using the standard finger technique, the row stagger only aligns well with our fingers on the right hand.** To help us visualize this, we will draw lines over the keyboard representing the natural up/down motion of our fingers. We are assuming that our arms approach the keyboard at an angle (70º or so) rather than being perpendicular to it:

![*No Angle Mod*](assets/no angle mod.png)

On the right hand, the green lines match well with the keys assigned to each finger. However, the same is not true on the left hand, with the bottom row being particularly misaligned. **There is a modified finger technique that aims to fix this, known as Angle mod. It consists of changing the finger assignments for the left bottom row:**

![*Yes Angle Mod*](assets/yes angle mod.png)

Although angle mod makes the stagger on the bottom row the same on both hands, the stagger on the top row will still align better with our fingers on the right hand vs the left.
In any case, the following are the keys that change fingers:

| With standard fingering: | With angle mod fingering: |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Qwerty Z → Pinky         | Qwerty Z → Ring           |
| Qwerty X → Ring          | Qwerty X → Middle         |
| Qwerty C → Middle        | Qwerty C → Index          |

## ANSI and ISO standards

The physical layout of the keyboard varies a bit depending on the country. **In the images below, the differences appear in blue:**

**ANSI** (American):

![*ANSI*](assets/ansi.png)

**ISO** (International):
![*ISO*](assets/iso.png)

**On ISO, the left shift key is split into two, while on ANSI it is not. This affects how angle mod is implemented on each.** The key difference is that, on ISO angle mod, the left pinky retains three keys just as with standard fingering. However, on ANSI angle mod the left pinky loses one key (now two total) while the left index finger gains one (now seven total). This will be better understood after seeing some practical angle mod examples.

Finally, note that, when angle mod is utilized later throughout this document it will be the ANSI version, as it works on any keyboard. ISO angle mod is exclusive to ISO keyboards.

## Angle modding a layout

**Modifying a layout that is arranged for standard fingering into one that uses angle mod fingering instead is known as angle modding the layout.** As already mentioned, this process is slightly different depending if we are using an ANSI or ISO keyboard.

### ANSI angle mod example

We start with [Colemak DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/) for standard fingering:

![*Colemak DH No Angle*](assets/colemak dh no angle.png)

Angle modding a layout requires two steps on ANSI keyboards:

The letters inside the yellow box (i.e. the bottom row left ring, middle and index finger keys) are all shifted one position to the left.

Since the letter inside the orange box (i.e. the bottom row left pinky key) loses its old spot, it is now moved to the new vacant spot on the left index.

The result is [angle modded Colemak DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/#angle-mod):

![*Colemak DH Yes Angle*](assets/colemak dh yes angle.png)

**When angle modding a layout, the original columns should remain the same.** By “column” we are referring to the letters each finger is supposed to press. Note how, on both the original and the angle modded versions, the <span style="color:pink">left ring</span> has a `WRX` column, the <span style="color:green">left middle</span> a `FSC` column, and the <span style="color:blue">left index</span> a `PTD` column.

Lastly, for a layout to be easily “angle moddable'' on ANSI keyboards, the character inside the orange box (`Z` in our example) should be a rare letter. The reason for this is that said letter actually changes fingers (it is moved from the left pinky to the left index) meaning that it will create letter interactions that the original layout did not account for. This will not be an issue as long as it is a rare letter, though.

### ISO angle mod example

We start with [Colemak DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/) for standard fingering:

![*Colemak DH Standard*](assets/colemak dh standard.png)

To [angle mod Colemak DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/#angle-mod) on a ISO keyboard, we simply have to shift the whole left bottom row one position to the left:

![*Colemak DH Iso Angle Mod*](assets/colemak dh iso angle.png)

On ISO, thanks to the additional pinky key, we do not need to move the bottom row left pinky letter (Z in our case) to the left index. That was only necessary on ANSI keyboards. Regardless, it is technically possible to use ANSI angle mod on an ISO keyboard, if we want.

## Un-angle modding a layout

When exploring alternative keyboard layouts, we will find lots of angle modded layouts. This is because most layouts were designed with row stagger in mind, and angle mod is the recommended finger technique on such keyboards.

If we want to learn a layout that has already been angle modded, but we plan on using it on a matrix keyboard, then we will have to un-angle mod the layout. After all, angle mod only makes sense on row stagger. For example, take angle modded [Noctum](https://oxey.dev/noctum/):

![*Noctum Keyboard Layout*](assets/noctum angle.png)

If we were to learn this layout on matrix, we would un-angle mod it first, as follows:

![*Unangled Noctum*](assets/noctum unangled.png)

## Errors to avoid with angle mod

### Learning a standard layout with angle mod fingering (angle cheat)

Take [APT](https://github.com/Apsu/APT#aptv3-layout) with standard fingering:

![*APT No Angle*](assets/apt no angle.png)

Imagine someone learned the layout above with angle mod fingering, but without actually angle modding the layout first. Doing so is known as “angle cheat”:

![*APT Wrong Angle*](assets/apt wrong angle.png)

Here we are making the layout noticeably worse, as bigrams that used to be typed with two fingers (e.g. <span style="color:green">CT</span>, <span style="color:blue">MP</span>, <span style="color:blue">MB</span>...) are now typed with the same finger on the second version.

In order to respect the original layout’s columns, we need to actually angle mod it:

![*APT Right Angle*](assets/apt right angle.png)

Anyway, both the first and third versions of the layout are correct, they just differ on the finger technique being utilized. The second version however has the columns wrong.

### Learning an angled modded layout with standard fingering

Take Rolly, which was designed with angle mod in mind:

![*Rolly Keyboard Layout*](assets/rolly angle.png)

Imagine someone learned the layout above with standard fingering, but without actually un-angle modding the layout first:

![vRolly Wrong Standard*](assets/rolly wrong standard.png)

Here we have effectively ruined the layout, as `H` and `E` are now sharing a finger. Consequently, <span style="color:green">HE</span> becomes a very common [same finger bigram](chapters/chapter3.md#same-finger-bigrams-(sfbs)) (a bigram where one finger presses two keys in a row). Although the original angle modded version only had 0.752% [SFBs](chapters/chapter3.md#same-finger-bigrams-(sfbs)) on the [Colemak mods analyzer](http://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/analyze.html), the second one goes all the way up to 4.286%!

Let’s say we did un-angle mod the layout before applying standard fingering:

![vRolly Right Standard*](assets/rolly right standard.png)

This way we are not causing unintended SFBs, as we are respecting the original columns. Having said that, on a row stagger keyboard, this third version would still be a downgrade compared to the first. This is because <span style="color:blue">H</span> and <span style="color:blue">P</span> are now much further apart from <span style="color:green">E</span> and <span style="color:green">U</span>, making bigrams like <span style="color:blue">H</span><span style="color:green">E</span>, <span style="color:blue">H</span><span style="color:green">U</span>, <span style="color:blue">P</span><span style="color:green">E</span> and <span style="color:blue">P</span><span style="color:green">U</span> less comfortable than before.

Anyway, the best version would be the very first one.

## How to tell if a layout is angle modded or not

Later in this document we will list and compare many different layouts. The layouts will often appear as just text. Depending on how that text is formatted, it will indicate one finger technique or the other:

**Standard fingering:**

[Gallium](https://github.com/GalileoBlues/Gallium/) (Bryson)
```
b l d c v  z y o u ,
n r t s g  p h a e i
q x m w j  k f ' ; .
```
For standard fingering, the columns will be strictly vertical. For example, the left hand on Gallium has a `BNQ` pinky, a `LRX` ring, a `DTM` middle and a `CSWVGJ` index.
Angle mod fingering:


<span style="color:blue">Isrt</span> (Whorf)
```
y c l m k  z f u , '
i s r t g  p n e a o ;
 v w d j q  b h / . x
```
For angle mod, the bottom row will be shifted one unit to the right. So, the left hand on Isrt has a `YI` pinky, a `CSV` ring, a `LRW` middle and a `MTDKGJQ` index. Remember that, with `ANSI` angle mod, the left pinky only has two keys, while the left index now has seven.

Sometimes we will use images (rather than text) to showcase a layout. In those cases, we will specify if the layout is angle modded or not to avoid any confusion. Regardless, as you become more familiar with layouts you will be able to easily tell if a layout is angle modded or not simply by glancing at the layout’s columns. For example:

![*Angled Noctum*](assets/noctum angle2.png)

The layout above has obviously been angle modded already. We can tell because its columns would not make sense otherwise. If we assume angle mod, we get a `BN` pinky, a `FSV` ring, a `DTM` middle and a `LRHZKXQ` index. Those are sensible columns on multiple fronts. For once, they cause negligible [same finger bigrams (SFBs)](chapters/chapter3.md#same-finger-bigrams-(sfbs)). Additionally, the weaker fingers have a low load (a `BN` pinky and a `FSV` ring) while the stronger fingers work harder. Instead, if we assumed that the layout above was not angle modded, we would get nonsensical columns (a `BNV` pinky, a `FSM` ring, a `DTH` middle and a `LRXZKQ` index).
